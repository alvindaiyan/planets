# Planets

![App preview][0]

Fictitious Flutter app for booking interplanetary trips.

This repository contains the code used in the [*"Refactoring a Legacy Flutter App"*][5] series. It shows: 1) how to perform a safe refactoring; 2) how to implement a robust testing strategy using widget and integrations tests; and 3) how to architect the app following the MVP pattern.

Each post in the series has a correspondent branch as follows:

* [Part 1: Widget Tests][3]
* [Part 2: MVP][4]

This app was originally created by [Sergi Martínez][1] and designed by [Vijay Verma][2].
